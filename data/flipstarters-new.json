This has resulted in successful campaigns to raise donations for the Bitcoin Cash full node implementations and more recently for Mainnet.Cash, where cumulatively over 2900 BCH was raised through Flipstarter alone. In observing these campaigns and gauging the response to them by the community, it came to my attention that some would prefer to donate funds to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing efforts rather than development. This is an area lacking attention and I am proposing that 650 BCH in donations are raised to produce Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing material in the form of high-quality videos.",
