      "description": "In recent months, members of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community have expressed their desire to fund useful initiatives through voluntary funding mechanisms like Flipstarter. This has resulted in successful campaigns to raise donations for the Bitcoin Cash full node implementations and more recently for Mainnet.Cash, where cumulatively over 2900 BCH was raised through Flipstarter alone. In observing these campaigns and gauging the response to them by the community, it came to my attention that some would prefer to donate funds to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing efforts rather than development. This is an area lacking attention and I am proposing that 650 BCH in donations are raised to produce Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing material in the form of high-quality videos.",

It was one of the first WooCommerce plugins to add support for Bitcoin Cash already in December 2017 and since then we have grown to nearly a thousand merchants that are utilizing CryptoWoo today. Cryptocurrency at its core is about privacy and true economic freedom and we respect those core values which is why we will never collect data about what products our customers sell, their customers, or any similar data. Our primary focus in this Flipstarter is the development of the plugin and the on-boarding of new merchants by providing them with all the benefits of Bitcoin Cash while also making the process of receiving payments in WooCommerce as simplistic and safe as possible. We will also reserve a portion of this money to hire developers with the skills required to speed up the development of the project.",

However, in large measure, the Bitcoin Cash community has unwittingly ignored the importance of SEO content and allowed those who are hostile or indifferent to electronic peer-to-peer cash to direct the narrative and define Bitcoin Cash in the eyes of the general public. That is, most of the SEO content out there on the topic of Bitcoin Cash is filled with outright lies or nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this Flipstarter campaign is Phase 2, which includes ongoing site maintenance, 36+ long-form evergreen blog posts (in addition to the twelve already-published articles), an overhaul of the landing page, regular revisions of content when needed, a continuation of the mailing list, continued email updates, a continued social media presence, expansion of the knowledge base, user guides for important and popular BCH products and software, and a PDF [lead magnet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lead-magnet.asp) designed to be a comprehensive comparison of the leading BCH wallets and their features. Each piece of content will target a specific keyword that research finds the public is using or will likely use in the near future.",

      "description": "# Who am I?\r\n\r\nHi, my name is Hampherny Rico, I'm from Caracas, Venezuela and I've been actively promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash since 2022.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/L5gRjnwT/00277372-2827-4417-8-AAB-5-B6-E98-C4-DF87.jpg)\r\n\r\nFirst I was promoting the use of BCH in different businesses in Caracas, which are still active accepting this payment method, most merchants after receiving the payment, exchange it in Binance or visit wholesale stores where they accept BCH and other Cryptocurrencies, the truth is that in an economy like Venezuela's this is very normal and despite the fact that inflation has been falling in recent years, Venezuelans have already learned to use different payment methods on digital platforms and pay with cash currencies such as the Dollar or the Euro and even in areas on the border with Colombia, Colombian Pesos are accepted.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/8PWfS5cM/20241223-030833.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter this, I organized in-person and online Meetups where the participants who attended were mostly people who knew nothing about Cryptocurrencies in general. After giving them introductory knowledge and explaining how to create their first wallet, they were also advised on how they should save their seed phrases and how to be responsible for their money, each of them was sent a little BCH.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/C1BLsPfk/20241223-032209.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Zqv1f1Vb/20241223-032324-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/sXhshMtJ/20241223-032406.jpg)\r\n\r\nI received an important diploma from the University of Carabobo (UC) where I am certified as a university professor, to educate in everything related to Cryptocurrencies and related areas.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/bwVhV0PT/20241223-033404.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis diploma opened many doors for me, and I was able to take advantage of this opportunity to promote the use of Bitcoin Cash in different Universities in Venezuela, through educational workshops and Crypto Fairs were also held with more than 30 entrepreneurs, who study at this University, the day that had the most impact was the one held at the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), since it is the number one University in the ranking of Universities in my Country, this was very important because it led to BCH being adopted by many students, and to this day this cryptocurrency is used as a payment method in this prestigious educational institution.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W1LrFZC5/20241223-034837.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wB9mFp6J/20241223-034923.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/FRRJ5VkH/20241223-035016.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/PNGLDG3C/20241223-034942.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1R8JDp7S/20241223-034958.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/yxRmty2S/20241223-040242.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a brief summary of my career, I mention it so that you can see the commitment I have with Bitcoin Cash and the desire for the adoption of BCH to grow more and more in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.\r\n\r\nIf you want to expand the information and learn more about my career, the latest work on the adoption of Bitcoin Cash in businesses, Meetups, workshops and fairs at universities, everything is published on my X account and different social networks, where I am @HamphernyR and the account of our adoption project is @CriptoCatia and we are also available on Instagram and Facebook.",
