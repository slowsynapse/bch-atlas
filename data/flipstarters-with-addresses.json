This has resulted in successful campaigns to raise donations for the Bitcoin Cash full node implementations and more recently for Mainnet.Cash, where cumulatively over 2900 BCH was raised through Flipstarter alone. In observing these campaigns and gauging the response to them by the community, it came to my attention that some would prefer to donate funds to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing efforts rather than development. This is an area lacking attention and I am proposing that 650 BCH in donations are raised to produce Bitcoin Cash (BCH) marketing material in the form of high-quality videos.",

That is why we have a second objective for this and for every campaign that we do:\r\n \r\n***Make a good reputation for Bitcoin Cash through our activities and encourage the EatBCH supply network to experiment with BCH rather than being trapped in the false choice between one fiat currency or another.***",

Moreover, we believe that the wallet must be aligned with a greater adoption strategy that ensures sustained user growth. In this document, we are laying out the details of such a strategy.\r\n\r\nWe have been refining our ideas and building out some prototypes that we think are ready to be brought to the next level. Our wallet app has been released in Google Play and Chrome Web Store and has been used by hundreds of testers who have given mostly positive feedback.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking support through individual donations to help us further carry out our mission. We would like to raise more or less $150,000 as pre-seed fund. This will provide us enough resources to develop, within 1 to 2 years, our MVP (minimum viable product) and discover a clear path to profitability.",

    "description": "# Overview And What This Is\r\n\r\n[BCHD](https://bchd.cash/) is a mature, full node implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol written in Go. It comes packed with developer-friendly features. The immediate goals of this project is to first and foremost support application development as a high performance blockchain server.\r\n\r\nSome of it's interesting features include:\r\n\r\n- It's internal indexing server. Using it, you no longer need to run an indexing server alongside your node.\r\n- It's really cool gRPC API that makes accessing your node's data very easy.\r\n- BCHD being ready for Neutrino. Neutrino's use of client-side filtering means users no longer have to disclose their BCH addresses to a third party to find out if they have received a transaction.\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nFor reading more about the features mentioned and BCHD's other features, please visit [the website](https://bchd.cash/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnfortunately on the last network upgrade, BCHD went out of consensus so someone needed to step up to implement the new changes.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to implement the upgrade has already been started. (See \"Estimation, Scope And More Details\" section.)\r\nIn my opinion, putting quiet some time and resources into implementing the new features and then just leaving them is not ideal at all. That's why I've been taking things a bit slowly to learn the codebase properly in the process so we'll have both the new changes implemented and a new maintainer for the project. Since the beginning, Josh Ellithorpe (@zquestz) have been helping me with that. (He will also handle the release management, tooling, website etc. - Not related to this campaign.)\r\n\r\nThere are things in life that are beyond our control when it comes to long periods of time, like I might not be able to see tomorrow. But my intention is to continue to support BCHD for \"at the very least\" a year or two, and preferably much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in summary I can say the goal of this campaign is a combination of both implementing the new features to bring back BCHD into consensus and through that, also having a new maintainer for the project.",

The Vault contract will rely on simple absolute block timelocks to prevent early redemptions ([BIP65](https://flowee.org/docs/spec/forks/bip-0065/), `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` c. 2014).\r\n\r\nThe Future Vault will be self-service. Any user may lock their own coins and obtain a fungible Futures token for a desired blocktime without ever participating in a market place or dex.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Vault, there will be tools for \"Coupon\" contracts, able to hold outputs that may **only** be used to provide an incentive to place one BCH into the Vault. The outputs on the \"Coupon\" offer a discount, paid \"up front\" to the user locking coins. The prevailing coupon rate accepted by the market (sats per coin per block) may act as a kind of defacto market interest rate or coin denominated interest bearing instrument on Bitcoin Cash.\r\n\r\nCoupons are simple UTXOs or outputs sent to the coupon contract directed at a specific futures Vault. As time progresses, the effective rate of return for unclaimed coupons increases as the number of remaining blocks decrease.",

    "description": "# Who am I?\r\n\r\nHi, my name is Hampherny Rico, I'm from Caracas, Venezuela and I've been actively promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash since 2022.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/L5gRjnwT/00277372-2827-4417-8-AAB-5-B6-E98-C4-DF87.jpg)\r\n\r\nFirst I was promoting the use of BCH in different businesses in Caracas, which are still active accepting this payment method, most merchants after receiving the payment, exchange it in Binance or visit wholesale stores where they accept BCH and other Cryptocurrencies, the truth is that in an economy like Venezuela's this is very normal and despite the fact that inflation has been falling in recent years, Venezuelans have already learned to use different payment methods on digital platforms and pay with cash currencies such as the Dollar or the Euro and even in areas on the border with Colombia, Colombian Pesos are accepted.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/8PWfS5cM/20241223-030833.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter this, I organized in-person and online Meetups where the participants who attended were mostly people who knew nothing about Cryptocurrencies in general. After giving them introductory knowledge and explaining how to create their first wallet, they were also advised on how they should save their seed phrases and how to be responsible for their money, each of them was sent a little BCH.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/C1BLsPfk/20241223-032209.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Zqv1f1Vb/20241223-032324-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/sXhshMtJ/20241223-032406.jpg)\r\n\r\nI received an important diploma from the University of Carabobo (UC) where I am certified as a university professor, to educate in everything related to Cryptocurrencies and related areas.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/bwVhV0PT/20241223-033404.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis diploma opened many doors for me, and I was able to take advantage of this opportunity to promote the use of Bitcoin Cash in different Universities in Venezuela, through educational workshops and Crypto Fairs were also held with more than 30 entrepreneurs, who study at this University, the day that had the most impact was the one held at the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), since it is the number one University in the ranking of Universities in my Country, this was very important because it led to BCH being adopted by many students, and to this day this cryptocurrency is used as a payment method in this prestigious educational institution.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W1LrFZC5/20241223-034837.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wB9mFp6J/20241223-034923.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/FRRJ5VkH/20241223-035016.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/PNGLDG3C/20241223-034942.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1R8JDp7S/20241223-034958.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/yxRmty2S/20241223-040242.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a brief summary of my career, I mention it so that you can see the commitment I have with Bitcoin Cash and the desire for the adoption of BCH to grow more and more in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.\r\n\r\nIf you want to expand the information and learn more about my career, the latest work on the adoption of Bitcoin Cash in businesses, Meetups, workshops and fairs at universities, everything is published on my X account and different social networks, where I am @HamphernyR and the account of our adoption project is @CriptoCatia and we are also available on Instagram and Facebook.",
